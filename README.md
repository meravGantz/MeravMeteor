Hey.

After you clone the repo just do:

meteor npm install

After that you will probably need to add meteor configuration in order to press the "Play" button, its very simple:

- At your top right screen you will see a arrow pointing down, press it and then click on "Edit configuration"
- Press the green + button located at the top left of popup screen.
-  Select Meteor from the list.
- Press Apply at the bottom right of the screen.
- Press OK.

Now you should be able to click the green "Run" button and everything should work.

Good luck!
